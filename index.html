	<p style="text-align: right;">17 June 2020, <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">0.00 AM </button></p>
	<p>It was an unproductive day with almost so less of time that was utilized. There was a sense of guilt, an inner sadness.</p><br>
	<p>After dinner, at 9pm amidst guilt of non-progressive day, I decided to do a quick silent ride to Tikathali, a place I been to tens of times if not hundreds. The time is mid-june, it had been already a few days since monsoon had entered the country. At least 70% of time, it rained. The night also had been pouring with rain and uncertainties in weather condition. But I had to somehow do the trip, a slow and relaxing one. It's been a long time since I hadn't have a visit. In this lockdown, I had tried a trip to Tikathali many times when I had a quick bike ride, but I used to touch Chakrapath and my intuition used to tell me to return back and not go. But, this night intuition was the one asking to go there.</p><br> 
	<p>Mom had already slept, I glanced at her silently then began to get ready for the trip. I had a few raincoats but they were not kept somewhere near and also they were black in color, color that I ought not to wear for a year. I just remember the pair of clothes that I had changed the morning, they were already dirty and they would go for a wash tommorow, so it won't matter if it gets dirty or wet, so I put onto that clothes, equipped with my keys to the house, my license and a mind wanting to recall back <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">those old memories of 2016</span>.</p><br>
	<hr>
	<h2>the start of trip</h2>
	<p>It was raining moderate, but still I got out of my main door and found the section of road infront of my house flooded.</p>
	<p class="text-muted text-secondary">Actually, I live in a densely condensed area meaning population density is so high and there is a poor rainwater management, even a slight hard rain causes the road to flood.</p>
	<p>I continued my journey through the flooded road asking forgiveness to baba ❤️ because of the colorful helmet I was going to wear throughout the trip. I took out the wet cover which was also flooded with water and started my journey assuring myself that I would return safely and promising myself to ride slow and safe. I travelled through the same flooded road infront of my home and turned right.</p><br>
	<p>Miraculously, the rain started turning faint, just I turned right, I saw a police board but still it was just standing in the empty road. Today was the day for even number plate vehicles to be permitted to run, but I had an odd number plate bike. I was lucky enough because it was already past 10:30 where all police had gone.</p><br>
	<p>I rode slowly and calmly until ring-road arrived, again, there was a check post but with no police, it used to be a very tight checkpost almost impossible to cross during the day time. I travelled through the empty Krishna Mandir road with few other speeding cars and bikes passing by. <a href="#">It was complete silence, similar to few days I used to travel to Tikathali during the old times when I had travelled between 10pm - 1am.</a> </p>
	<hr>
	<h2>the road section that started it all</h2>
	<p><small>I completed the wide road section and reached to the narrow down two lanes section on the way. This was the section which had a perfect black top in most part like the one that exists in developed countries beyond Nepal.</small></p>
	<p><small>This is the road section that has remained similar and perfect even after so many trips passed from it.</small></p><br>
	<p>I still vividly remember the scenes of that road which was like a semi-country side village feeling with few village styles poles in between of green fields. It was the scene <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">from the first travel to Tikathali with phone placed on the top<br> of phone stand based on the 30m accuracy GPS location result.</span> (It means that the location was deviated from about 30m from it's original location because GPS was not turned on at the moment that location was registered). This trip was the crazy yet silly mission to find the house.</p><br>
	<p>The road was completely empty except a few street dogs roaming around. This was the same road of hope that I had, looking at every passing person with a curiosity and amazement. But, this road of expectation was empty today.</p><br>
	<p>I soon reached the junction, where the road had already started to become a bit rude and muddy. I completed all of those section with the belief that I won't slip across and started to realize hundreds of similar roads that I had already travelled across in the years prior.</p><br>
	<div class="form-group has-danger">
	  <label class="form-control-label" for="inputDanger1">Quote that struck onto me.</label>
	  <input type="text" value='"You have to travel through the rain' class="form-control is-invalid" id="inputInvalid">

	  <div class="invalid-feedback">The roads started turning harsher and harsher as I approached to the section of the then Tikathali VDC office area. The area used to be the one where I had spent 1/3rd of time I have had ever been there. <br><br>
	  Later the above quote changed.</div>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h2>the same challenge, harshness, <span class="badge badge-dark"> put onto, <span class="text-danger">again</span></span>.</h2>
	</div>
	<p>The roads had now turned miserable even difficult to walk. This was the worst road section of the trip; even difficult to walk. This was the same section when on the first day I was stuck badly in mud. The fate was to return the same consequence once again, but in a different fashion this time.</p><br>
	<p>At previous times, the VDC and low populated Tikathali area with 20s of VDC had now turned into a fully fledged municipality with 10 major wards out of which the VDC office had turned into ward 5 VDC. The plots of lands that used to be empty a decade prior are now starting to get popular and filled in with homes due to growing hotspots in Kathmandu Valley with the population sky-rocketing and hotspots like Tikathali truly turning into proud little towns though they may not be able to grow and prosper as a city.</p><br>
	<div class="list-group">
	  <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start active">
	    <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
	      <h5 class="mb-1">Why above paragraph?</h5>
	    </div>
	    <p class="mb-1 text-info">the above paragraph seemed completely pointless in this scenario but, </p>
	    <p class="mb-1">it realized to me how everything is going and prospering, also realizing the soon need for us to also grow and prosper together in life. It is with a small but a continuous evolution that we turn from a barren desert into a rainforest. Obviously a rainforest takes hundreds of years to grow. similarly, a human takes years or to some, even takes decades due to their circumstances. in the later course of trip, i further realized that how growing together boosts up the growth!</p>
	    <small>one of the best parts of the trip.</small>
	  </a>
	</div><br>
	<p>25% of the road section trip was completed just by slipping a few times and changing the paths of travel in different lanes of the road where it was clear. the place where I was previously stuck, the place which the false location showed had already passed. that time due to gps errors, I had stuck there and it was so damn hard that I remember that if there wouldn't have been a person that pushed me that day off the steep slippery cliff, I wouldn't have been able to climb out. the place I was stuck was bit elevated down than the road. the mud had ruined all his clothes, but yet he decided to help. that time it taught a brutal lesson to me.</p><br>
	<p>but, this time, there was a pile of "roda", one used for "dhalan" kept in the middle of the road. I could see with the faint headlights that after that road was completely so harsh to travel on. I decided to get off and inspect the road ahead. I saw the road wasn't that bad, and I had the confidence, and support from the strong feeling to feel all the past memories once again despite the difficulties I may feel. I climbed the "roda" succesfully and descended back onto the road.</p>
	<div class="card text-white bg-danger mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">
	  <div class="card-header">and the misery starts</div>
	  <div class="card-body">
	    <h4 class="card-title">To my terror,</h4>
	    <p class="card-text">There was a no proper way out ahead. And there was a no straight way out. Also ground beneath was so soft due to rain and erosion that the further I moved, the further I felt going a bit down. The road was divided into two parts by a feet high mud track. From the roda side, it was a bit on the higher side. on the left was the mud track, so, I travelled infront to see if there is any way through the pole. I was shocked to see that the road was even difficult than mud track.</p>
	    <hr>
	    <p class="card-text">I was stumbled but full of hope this time than the previous time. I had already got off the bike and my feet had already started to catch mud. Turning even by an inch in that layer of mud felt hellish, I tried to turn left, but it was so difficult. I had to put so much effort even in moving the bike a bit. To my terror, my slipper torn apart, I had just fixed it in the morning, it made the time even horrific and horrible than before. As it was torn apart, the slippers that were doing fine, turned so slippery and it made the whole process so messy. In one hand, I had to make sure the torn slippers to not get off my feet, next I am turning the bike to left cuz I saw a point of probable escape where the mud was a bit inch lower.</p>
	    <hr>
	    <p class="card-text">I realized, I couldn't get help because it was already 11:07. At one point, it felt like it was from my mistake that I wore the wrong color helmet. I decided not to give up and not let this obstacle to ruin the mesmerizing feeling I was feeling and experiencing in the trip. I changed my quote from the point on to "difficult roads often lead to most beautiful destinations." Indeed the destination was the road and place of memories in every twist and turn, every corner and every point. It was that sense of togetherness and belongingness that led me to push harder. I was stuck even deeper but slowly along with efforts used some special techniques to try to get off.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>After a few moments, I was finally freed from that 1 feet track and liberated on to the road that was still difficult but not difficult as before. I felt it was the result of togetherness and togetherness that let motivational powers within me to burst out and lay free from that mud. That's the best point of togetherness that I love and cherish.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>chowk, home and return roads</h2>
	<p>I descended down the slope. I re-learnt the power of togetherness for adding value and motivation to life. I noticed the home standing as it used to be. The environment was full of sounds from frogs making sounds in the same pitch level.
	I noticed the road being a bit different, and in construction. I also noticed so many new homes being constructing obstructive the nature wise feelings and vibes the plot of empty land and green crops at that place used to give.</p><br>
	<p>At this point, I had legs full of mud, and I remember each of feeligs that I used to have while returning. I had every thoughts and feelings of every type from when I had a meet to simple roaming days, to when day of disappointment or day of enjoyment or accomplishment or day of tiredness was the reason to visit Tikathali, also with those divine feelings. The chowk was similar. Immediately 3-4 reminders struck my mind, one when mom and thy were travelling back from somewhere, the pharmacy, the points where I received those hurried calls, final calls before abroad, and places that I had tried new food in, also the stick food house incident that is unforgetable along with that rushed day where I had to eat that panipuri and chatpate before "oshinu" that I had to take to home in Gwarko (not my densely populated home) where I usually hangout most of the time for study.</p>
	<div class="card border-success mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">
	  <div class="card-header">all forgotten within seconds</div>
	  <div class="card-body">
	    <h4 class="card-title">amazingly,</h4>
	    <p class="card-text">even with feet still covered in mud, the horrific experiences, all of the forementioned disappeared within seconds following the mesmerization felt. I learnt lesson to stand by whatever be the conditions and never give up on what I am doing, and also to take risks is absolutely important for meaningful, valuable and successful life from the experience I had in the mud. from the narephate visit, to using of the narephate and tikathali road to completely avoid Koteshowor jams while returning from the highway, to the thrill of travelling that road being benifitted by my morning shift! WOW!! to knowing all the names of colleges and uniforms wow, knowing and learning the road structure, to that examination centre, everything was completely fabulous! Also, the thrill felt after each meet returning from that roads was inevitable to come into the mind at that point. Every return would be rushed to see the face of baba after visiting the place to double that pleasure so felt!</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<p>The proverb that used to be said by all those old aged become so true, we realize the power of experience. I was stuttled (don't know even the word exists) to find out that the congested and close calls escapes from the front-coming vehicles would be the thing of past. Following the constant rains in the few days, </p>
	<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
	  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>
	  <strong>Oh snap!</strong> the bridge connecting Tikathali and Balkumari <a href="#" class="alert-link">was broken</a>. There was a temporary bridge but so dangerous to be used.
	</div>
	<p>that was a sad moment, to see just the remains. It re-realized me the true essence and power of mother nature and insignificance of us in this world! but, I remembered and used the road that I used the fifteenth time.</p><br>
	<p>there was a next bridge which was standing so strong, it also served as an example for how we to be in life. I never saw that river in so force and roaring like that despite I have crossed the river in a few rainy seasons prior.</p><br>
	<p>After that, wow, I reached into ring road, the place or lets say an analagous situation I would like to be in life, with grandness, greatness, peace, harmony, stability, prosperity, independent, reliable, all the qualities that the ring road seemed to have within realizing that it was one of the example roads even in Asia! A perspective wide like chakrapath is to be slowly developed. With all these thoughts, I travelled forth and noticed the '50 kmh' board, after which I synchronized the speed to fifty, and entered into my section from the same old police checking at where I could see a policeman almost into sleep!</p><br>
	<p>A writer inside seemed to be asking me to document most if not all the feelings I had during the trip.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Reaching home and final words</h2>
	<p class="lead">It must have been long and boring?? to read, though it was a small summary portion of my thoughts during an hour trip! I reached home and started to clean my muddy legs. I was so suprised to find out that inspite of being so deeply trenched into mud, neither bike nor me was that dirty. None, like ones that used to happen before! I was able to clean it with so less water! I cleaned the important sections of the bike and promised him/her to give a loving bath tommorow! My legs were so relieved after removing that layer of mud, it felt like removing all the dreaded past memories, it realized me how it must feel to kill off if not all, most of the memories of past. I filled in the drum that I used water from, leaving no way for suspect from this small mischieveous mission! I re-changed to my original clothes! and boy, that feeling was so awesome to get off those stinky clothes off!</p>
	<p class="lead">I mistakenly struck to the main door while going in and out for cleaning, due to which dogs in locality thought I was a thief, until I called them and reminded them by massaging their heads that I was not their enemy after which they left happily! I kept my bike in the chowk where I always use to and reached room at 12.00 am exact</p>
	<p class="lead">I reached home safely and found my mom sleeping as soundly as before not realizing that her son had been through so much! I put all my belonging into place and as soon as I sat in my room, moderate rain starts falling again! It must have been the love of baba with which he did not let me to get while I was out. Still, it rains while I write at the time of exact 3 am. It was 2.5 hours of typing writing this. It was almost constant typing. It wouldn't have been possible if I was not practicing typing! It was an amazing typing session practice, I am sure my typing has increased by one or two wpm (word per minute) during this typing session and this story which is summarized otherwise would have turned into a book. and wow, you made my night, with your messages! <3</p><br>
